# ImageProcess
There are now two functions: 
1. Extracting the sequence of images from the 4D data; 
2. Calculating the psnr of all the types of pictures in both directories.

NOTE:
Please do not name the image as 1, 2, 3 to calculate psnr, 
because python reads follow 1, 10, 11, preferably in the format %0xd (x is an arbitrary number), 
such as 0001, 0002, 0003, if you have to name 1, 2, 3, it's also work,
but the current program doesn't add the module to adjust the order.Maybe I can add later.

Currently only my collaborators can use function one, and some things are not uploaded.
